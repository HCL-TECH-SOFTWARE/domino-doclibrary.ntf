## Add a document to this database: 
Click the New Document action from any of the views.

## Respond to a document: 
Open a document, then click the Response action.  From a Notes Client, you can also highlight that document in a view, then click Response from there.  For Notes Client users, this creates a response to the main document in the thread.  For browser clients, this creates a response to the current document.

## Respond to a response:
From a Notes Client, highlight the response you wish to respond to, then click Response to Response.  This function is performed from a browser by using the Response action, as described above.

## Flag a document as Private:
You can use the "Mark Private" and "Mark Public" actions in the template to control whether anyone other than yourself can read a specific document.  For example, if you have not completed the writing of a particular document, you can click the "Mark Private" action and others will not be able to see the document.  When you complete the document, you can click the "Mark Public" action to make it available for others to read.  If a document is marked private after it has been submitted for review, the document author and the reviewers will be able to read the document.
